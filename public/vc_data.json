To achieve this goal, we believe that companies must deploy a set of innovations capable of generating a vast competitive advantage. When these conditions are met, Pitanga is prepared to provide the capital necessary to develop and commercialize such technologies. We contribute with the required capital and support the companies by participating in the board of directors. We have no limitations regarding sectors or geographies. However, we prefer investing in Latin American companies with a significant regional presence. We intend to invest in a limited number of companies to be chosen through a rigorous selection process. Pitanga Invest, an investment vehicle constituted in 2014 based on our association with Brazilian entrepreneurs, is already fully deployed and closed for new investments. In 2020, again in association with Brazilian entrepreneurs, we launched Pitanga Redux, a new investment vehicle with capital available for investment in new projects.<\/p>",

High-value data, and its infrastructure, creates defensible companies with lower costs of scaling. We typically invest in the &ldquo;early growth&rdquo; stage of a company &ndash; when there is some revenue and signs of product\/market fit, but it is not yet a consensus bet. We like this stage because we excel at driving momentum through targeted BD support, crafting platform strategies powered by core data assets, and preparing a company for growth financing. Our hands-on GPs have a unique ability to identify, underwrite, and support businesses built around high-value data. Our team&#39;s experience &ndash; working together in this space since 2013 &ndash; brings differentiated insights into how data can be leveraged to create value.

My area of focus is B2B enterprise focused tech companies that build and sell mission critical technologies to their customers (\u201cmission critical\u201d defined as companies whose products are hard to rip and replace). \r\n\u2022 Companies must have $5-10mm+ in revenues and must have established a product market fit. \r\n\u2022 The Company should have raised 1-2 rounds of institutional capital \r\n\u2022 The Company can be burning money (in fact 90%+ of all the businesses we look at are investing back in operations and hence have a burn) but the idea is that with our capital the Company has a fully funded plan to breakeven\/profitability. \r\n\r\nOur Typical Deal Structure\r\n------------------------------\r\n\u2022 Check Size: $5-50mm+ in single or multiple tranches\r\n\u2022 Term: 4-5 year terms with 18-24+ months of interest only periods and then level amortization \r\n\u2022 Yield: 14-18% range that includes the Interest Rate and Fees \r\n\u2022 Warrants: 0.5% - 2.0% ownership on a fully diluted ownership\r\n\u2022 Covenants: Bespoke per deal but we track the company to the key performing indicators that the BoD tracks",
